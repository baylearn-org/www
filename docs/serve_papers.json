[{"UID":"4","abstract":"Modern machine learning systems rely on rich datasets that often contain sensitive personal information, and while traditional anonymization removes explicit identifiers, it can harm performance and remains vulnerable to inference attacks, underscoring the need for stronger privacy protections during training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user privacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that jointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the privacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a minimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading semantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy preserving data generation in the era of large language models.","authors":"Aria Shi (Santa clara university)*; Yefeng  Yuan (Santa clara university); Liang  Cheng (ebay); Yuhong  Liu (Santa clara university); Yi  Fang (Santa Clara University)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Beyond PII: Preserving Implicit User Privacy via LLM-Generated Synthetic Data Guided by Reinforcement Learning"},{"UID":"5","abstract":"This paper summarizes Thumbtack\u2019s successful application of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve message moderation within its Trust and Safety Platform (TSP).

We hypothesize that the internal attention mechanisms of an SLM, which reflect its cognitive load during processing, can serve as a robust predictor of task complexity. Instead of relying on a single confidence score, our method quantifies this cognitive load by extracting a multi-dimensional feature vector from the SLM's attention patterns. These features include: 1) Attention Entropy, to measure the uncertainty in attention distribution; 2) Attention Variance, to capture the dispersion of attention weights; and 3) Attention Concentration (max attention value), to gauge focus on specific tokens.  Our core technical contribution is a lightweight complexity predictor, implemented as a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which is trained to map these attention features to a continuous complexity score. As explicit complexity labels are unavailable, we generate proxy labels through a self-supervised process: an SLM (TinyLlama-1B) processes tasks from the GSM8K dataset, and its output is compared to the ground truth.Once trained, this highly efficient predictor runs locally, analyzing the SLM's attention from a single forward pass to make a dynamic routing decision: tasks with a predicted complexity score above a threshold are offloaded to a cloud-based LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), while simpler tasks are handled by the edge SLM.

Our results show that this structured, rule-based approach significantly boosts LLM performance in logical fallacy classification. Our study demonstrates the potential for combining LLMs with symbolic reasoning to advance AI capabilities.","authors":"Peiyu Wang (University of California, Santa Cruz)*","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Follow My Lead: Logical Fallacy Classification with Knowledge-Augmented LLMs"},{"UID":"98","abstract":"This paper presents a new method for efficiently decoding multiple queries over the same content in Transformer language models. This is particularly useful for tasks that have many prompts with the shared prefix, as document question answering with a large number of questions for each document. Traditional methods prompt the language model with each query independently in a batch or combine multiple questions together into one larger prompt. However, both approaches are based on the autoregressive fashion with one token per homogeneous forward pass, which uses inefficient matrix-vector products for every sequence in the batch. These methods also encounter issues such as a duplicate key-value cache,  quality degradation, or redundant memory when large key-value (KV) caches are accessed from memory, which leads to wasted GPU memory and decreased performance. Our proposed method addresses these challenges by decoding queries all at once in parallel, replacing matrix-vector products with more efficient matrix-matrix products, and improving efficiency without compromising result quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively increases throughput.","authors":"zekun zhao (UCSC)*; Jeffrey Flanigan (UCSC)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Inference With Parallel Is All You Need"},{"UID":"99","abstract":"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, we empirically investigate \\emph{visual fairness} in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for unfairness mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future unfairness reduction efforts.","authors":"Xuyang Wu (Santa Clara University)*; Yuan Wang (Santa Clara University); Hsin-Tai Wu (Docomo Innovations); Zhiqiang Tao (Rochester Institute of Technology); Yi Fang (Santa Clara University)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Evaluating Fairness in Large Vision-Language Models Across Diverse Demographic Attributes and Prompts"},{"UID":"100","abstract":"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automatic generation of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, leading to strong performance on tasks such as math and code. However, when reasoning steps reflect social stereotypes (e.g., those related to gender, race or age), they can reinforce harmful associations and lead to misleading conclusions. We present the first systematic evaluation of social bias within LLM-generated reasoning, using the BBQ dataset to analyze both prediction accuracy and bias. Our study spans a wide range of mainstream reasoning models, including instruction-tuned and CoT-augmented variants of DeepSeek-R1 (8B/32B), ChatGPT, and other open-source LLMs. We quantify how biased reasoning steps correlate with incorrect predictions and often lead to stereotype expression. To mitigate reasoning-induced bias, we propose Answer Distribution as Bias Proxy (ADBP), a lightweight mitigation method that detects bias by tracking how model predictions change across incremental reasoning steps. ADBP outperforms a stereotype-free baseline in most cases, mitigating bias and improving the accuracy of LLM outputs.","authors":"Xuyang Wu (Santa Clara University)*; Jinming  Nian (Santa Clara University); Ting-Ruen  Wei (Santa Clara University); Zhiqiang Tao (Rochester Institute of Technology); Hsin-Tai  Wu (Docomo Innovations); Yi Fang (Santa Clara University)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Does Reasoning Introduce Bias?

However, these prompts frequently fail in real-world settings where challenging cases are abundant. To address this gap, we propose \\textbf{MAPO} (\\underline{M}inimax \\underline{A}daptive \\underline{P}rompt \\underline{O}ptimisation), a framework that strengthens initial prompts without relying on human-annotated data or trained reward models. MAPO jointly (i) mines label-preserving adversarial examples that maximize a solver's error and (ii) refines the solver\u2019s prompt to fix each new failure. Starting from LLM-generated seed pairs $(x, y)$, MAPO iteratively perturbs each $x$ to increase its \\emph{hardness score}, defined by low self-certainty or high failure rate under multi-sample evaluation. Prompt refinement is performed using the \\emph{Residual Optimisation Tree} (RiOT) algorithm, which prevents semantic drift. Crucially, MAPO expands the dataset with progressively harder examples after each successful prompt update, maintaining a stable minimax game that avoids over-specialization. Experiments show that MAPO improves prompt robustness, outperforming existing prompt optimization baselines without any human labels or reward models.","authors":"Zhiyuan Peng (Santa Clara University)*; Liyi Zhang (Princeton University); Tin  Nguyen (University of Maryland); Chen Zhang (Navan Inc.); Itamar Kahn (Columbia University)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"MAPO: Minimax Adaptive Prompt Optimization without Data or Rewards"},{"UID":"102","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit the ability to generalize given few-shot examples in their input prompt, an emergent capability known as in-context learning (ICL).

Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference.

We show that aligning to heterogeneous preferences with a single policy is best achieved using the average reward across user types. However, this requires additional information about annotators. We examine improvements under different information settings, focusing on direct alignment methods. We find that minimal information can yield first-order improvements, while full feedback from each user type leads to consistent learning of the optimal policy.

A widely adopted technique in this context is the exploitation of activation sparsity, which arises from the properties of activation functions. Such sparsity presents a trade-off between model accuracy and resource utilization, and sparsity exploitation methods typically involve tunable hyperparameters that influence this trade-off. In this work, we propose an adaptive control mechanism that dynamically tunes these hyperparameters in an online manner during inference, enabling real-time adjustment without requiring offline retraining or manual tuning. Our method leverages the typically underutilized CPU in conventional CPU-GPU systems to monitor the inference process and adapt activation sparsity parameters in real time using either a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller or Reinforcement Learning (RL). Applied to state-of-the-art activation sparsity exploitation frameworks, our adaptive approach consistently outperforms statically tuned baselines in terms of both accuracy and inference speed. Furthermore, we present novel insights into the behavior and effectiveness of activation sparsity in on-device LLM inference, enabled by our adaptive tuning methodology.","authors":"Ethan Lin (Santa Clara University)*; Hoeseok Yang (Santa Clara University); Youngmin Yi (Sogang University)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Adaptive Control of Inference-Time Activation Sparsity for On-Device LLMs"}]
