Geospatial data comprises of acquired and derived heterogeneous data modalities that we transform to semantically meaningful, image-like tensors to address the challenges of representation, alignment, and fusion of multimodal data. SeMAnD is comprised of (i) a simple data augmentation strategy, called RandPolyAugment, capable of generating diverse augmentations of vector geometries, and (ii) a self-supervised training objective with three components that incentivize learning representations of multimodal data that are discriminative to local changes in one modality which are not corroborated by the other modalities. Detecting local defects is crucial for geospatial anomaly detection where even small anomalies (e.g., shifted, incorrectly connected, malformed, or missing polygonal vector geometries like roads, buildings, landcover, etc.) are detrimental to the experience and safety of users of geospatial applications like mapping, routing, search, and recommendation systems. Our empirical study on test sets of different types of real-world geometric geospatial anomalies across 3 diverse geographical regions demonstrates that SeMAnD is able to detect real-world defects and outperforms domain-agnostic anomaly detection strategies by 4.8-19.7% as measured using anomaly classification AUC.

Current approaches to mitigating unfaithfulness typically involve post-processing corrections or contrastive learning from synthetically generated negative samples, which do not fully address the spectrum of errors that can arise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to fine-tune LLMs specifically to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans of text in generated summaries. We first annotate span-level hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries using automatic labeling with GPT-4. We then fine-tune the LLM using both summaries with no hallucinations and spans of hallucinated text to improve the faithfulness of the model. This paper introduces a dataset labeled to distinguish between faithful and unfaithful content and compare the performance of three techniques: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Our experimental results show that unlikelihood training can effectively use span-level annotations to enhance summary faithfulness, reducing the number of summaries with hallucinations from 31% to 13%, a reduction of 58% on the CNN summarization dataset and from 33% to 20%, a reduction of 39% on the SAMSum dataset.","authors":"Sicong Huang (University of California, Santa Cruz)*; Qianqi Yan (University of California, Santa Cruz); Shengze Wang (University of California, Santa Cruz); Ian Lane (University of California, Santa Cruz)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Improving the Faithfulness of LLM-based Abstractive Summarization with Span-level Unlikelihood Training"},{"UID":"11","abstract":"We propose a new model for dimensionality reduction, the PCA tree, which works like a regular autoencoder, having explicit projection and reconstruction mappings.

Inference here is very fast because only a small subset of class probabilities need to be computed, yet the model is quite accurate.

The tree structure itself is learned optimally by interleaving steps that grow the structure with steps that optimize the parameters of the current structure. This makes it possible to learn STs that can grow much deeper but in an irregular way, adapting to the data distribution.

With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that one can build a working dialogue agent in an unsupervised setting inferring these API interactions from unlabeled dialogues. We propose a novel approach using expectation maximization (EM) with a noisy-channel model to infer all of the turn-level annotations needed for training an agent as latent variables, and then use them to train an end-to-end agent. We find that an unsupervised agent trained using our approach more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong zero-shot GPT-3.5 baseline on the MultiWOZ benchmark.","authors":"Brendan D King (University of California, Santa Cruz)*; Jeffrey Flanigan (University of California, Santa Cruz)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Unsupervised End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialogue with LLMs: The Power of the Noisy Channel"},{"UID":"45","abstract":"Language model pre-training is usually performed in a task-agnostic manner.

Softmax in SoftmaxAttn can sometimes lead to a concentration of attention on a few features (Yang et al., 2018; Ganea et al., 2019), potentially neglecting informative aspects of the input. Moreover, applying SoftmaxAttn requires performing a reduction along the length of the input sequence, which slows down computation (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023).

A critical aspect of these guardrails is the protection of user privacy, especially as the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) intensifies in both consumer and enterprise environments. The task of PII detection becomes increasingly complex as models are trained on extensive datasets, making previously dispersed information accessible through model inference.  This paper addresses the challenge of user data protection within the framework of guardrails. We present a suite of methods designed to mitigate privacy risks associated with extensive data usage, applicable during both the training and inference phases. Our approach employs a multi-stage process that integrates entity recognition, context classification, and sophisticated policies aligned with various regulatory standards. We demonstrate the superiority of our solution by benchmarking it against leading open-source PII detectors, showcasing enhanced extraction performance in most cases.  Additionally, we provide insights into the real-world deployment of our method, specifically highlighting its application in identifying private data within public GitHub repositories to ensure code-of-conduct compliance.

We propose a smoothed softmax loss and a pairwise ranking index inference scheme that can be applied to the distribution agnostic watch time prediction problem and improve the prediction accuracy. Specifically, the smoothed softmax loss utilizes information from watch time distribution rather than a single point, and the pairwise ranking index inference employs the relative order of watch time rather than their absolute values for ranking purposes. Through comprehensive offline evaluation and online experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of smoothed softmax loss and pairwise ranking index inference.

In this paper, we empirically revisit\u2014on synthetic and real data\u2014the issue of variable encoding and its impact on modeling bias. We introduce a new metric of feature influence to quantitatively evaluate such effect. The results indicate that contrary to common practice, ordinal and nominal variables should not necessarily be coded differently. Indeed, differences in coding can lead to differences in variable availability to the model, which dominate other effects and lead to modeling bias (and thus potentially to unfairness). We remark that well regularized universal approximators can handle variables encoded identically (regardless of whether they are ordinal or nominal), without adverse effects on generalization, while reducing problems of bias. Various encodings may yield better results in various contexts, so the choice of encoding should be considered a hyper-parameter of the workflow.","authors":"Daniel R Kopp (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)*; Benjamin Maudet (Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay); Kristin Bennett (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)","keywords":"","sessions":"A/B","title":"Encoding Matters: Impact of Categorical Variable Encoding on Performance and Bias"},{"UID":"67","abstract":"The music streaming industry faces streaming manipulation, where bad actors inflate stream counts to boost chart rankings and royalty payments.

Recent work proposed leveraging latent audio representations from music generation models towards music information retrieval tasks (e.g. genre classification, emotion recognition), which suggests that high-level musical characteristics are encoded in these models.
