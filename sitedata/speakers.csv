In a surprising third act for anyone doing NLP in the 70s, 80s, 90s, or 2000s, in much of the popular media, artificial intelligence is now synonymous with language models. In this talk, I want to take a look backward at where language models came from and why they were so slow to emerge, and a look forward at some topics of recent research with an emphasis on where a linguistic perspective still has relevance. I emphasize the importance of systematic generalization, which encourages still looking for alternative neural architectures, like Mixture-of-Experts Universal Transformers (MoEUTs) and models that have exploration, reasoning, and interaction, which encourages looking at tasks that interact with the world, such as web agents.","Christopher Manning is the inaugural Thomas M. Siebel Professor in Machine Learning in the Departments of Computer Science and Linguistics at Stanford University, a Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), and a General Partner at AIX Ventures. He was the Director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) 2018â€“2025. His research is on computers that can intelligently process, understand, and generate human languages. Chris is the most-cited researcher within Natural Language Processing (NLP), with best paper awards at the ACL, Coling, EMNLP, and CHI conferences and three consecutive ACL Test of Time awards for his early work on neural network or deep learning approaches to human language understanding, which led into modern Large Language Models and Generative AI. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and recipient of the 2024 IEEE John von Neumann Medal and an honorary doctorate from U. Amsterdam. He founded the Stanford NLP group, has written widely used NLP textbooks, and teaches the popular NLP class CS224N, watched by hundreds of thousands online.","keynote","https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/",""
